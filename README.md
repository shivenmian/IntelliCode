# IntelliCode

IntelliCode is a slackbot I wrote in under an hour, which gives you instant coding answers! It returns answers taken up from StackOverflow (accepted answers / the most voted ones) for your queries. 

Built this for Byldathon v10, IIIT Delhi.

TODO: 
1. Integrate Flask into it, and add it to the Slack App Directory.
2. Try doing sentiment analysis of replies to see if the answer (if not accepted) was satisfactory.
