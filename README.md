# IntelliCode

IntelliCode is a slackbot I wrote in under an hour, which gives you instant coding answers! It returns answers scraped from StackOverflow (accepted answers / the most voted ones) for your queries. 

Built this for Byldathon v10, IIIT Delhi.

TODO: Integrate Flask into it, and add it to the Slack App Directory.
